# scx_pair


### Overview

A sibling scheduler which ensures that tasks will only ever be co-located on a
physical core if they're in the same cgroup. It illustrates how a scheduling
policy could be implemented to mitigate CPU bugs, such as L1TF, and also shows
how some useful kfuncs such as `scx_bpf_kick_cpu()` can be utilized.

### Typical Use Case

While this scheduler is only meant to be used to illustrate certain sched_ext
features, with a bit more work (e.g. by adding some form of priority handling
inside and across cgroups), it could have been used as a way to quickly
mitigate L1TF before core scheduling was implemented and rolled out.

### Production Ready?

### Overview

Another simple, yet slightly more complex scheduler that provides an example of
a basic weighted FIFO queuing policy. It also provides examples of some common
useful BPF features, such as sleepable per-task storage allocation in the
`ops.prep_enable()` callback, and using the `BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE` map type to
enqueue tasks. It also illustrates how core-sched support could be implemented.

### Typical Use Case

Purely used to illustrate sched_ext features.

### Production Ready?

No

### Overview

A simple scheduler that provides an example of a minimal sched_ext
scheduler. `scx_simple` can be run in either global weighted vtime mode, or
FIFO mode.
