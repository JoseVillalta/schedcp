## Missing Features from Paper

### Critical Missing Components

#### 1. **Workload Analysis Engine** (Section 4.2.1)
**Paper Requirements:**
- Tiered access to performance data (API endpoints, sandbox, feedback)
- Secure sandbox for profiling tools (perf, top, strace)

**Current State:** Not implemented

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Create WorkloadAnalysisEngine module

- [ ] Implement feedback channel for post-deployment metrics

#### 2. **Scheduler Policy Repository** (Section 4.2.2)
**Paper Requirements:**
- Vector database for storing eBPF scheduler code
- Semantic search capabilities
- Rich metadata (descriptions, target workloads, performance metrics)
- Code reuse and composition features
- Historical performance tracking

**Current State:** Basic scheduler listing from static JSON, no repository functionality

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement vector database (e.g., using Qdrant or similar)
- [ ] Add semantic search using embeddings
- [ ] Store actual eBPF code and metadata
- [ ] Create APIs for policy retrieval and updates
- [ ] Add performance metric tracking per policy

#### 3. **Execution Verifier** (Section 4.2.3)
**Paper Requirements:**
- Multi-stage validation pipeline
- Static analysis (eBPF verifier + custom checks)
- Dynamic validation in micro-VMs
- Signed deployment tokens
- Circuit breaker with automatic rollback
- Canary deployment mechanism

**Current State:** Direct scheduler execution without validation

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Create ExecutionVerifier module
- [ ] Implement static analysis pipeline
- [ ] Add micro-VM based dynamic validation
- [ ] Create deployment token system
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker and rollback mechanism
- [ ] Add canary deployment support

#### 4. **Multi-Agent System (sched-agent)** (Section 5)
**Paper Requirements:**
- Four specialized agents: Observation, Planning, Execution, Learning
- In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL)
- Agent coordination and communication
- Specialized prompts and tools per agent

**Current State:** No agent implementation

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Create agent framework infrastructure
- [ ] Implement Observation Agent
- [ ] Implement Planning Agent
- [ ] Implement Execution Agent
- [ ] Implement Learning Agent
- [ ] Add inter-agent communication system
- [ ] Integrate with Claude Code subagent architecture

### Secondary Missing Features

#### 5. **Advanced Monitoring and Metrics**
- Real-time performance monitoring during execution
- Detailed metrics collection (CPU, memory, latency, throughput)
- Performance comparison between schedulers
- Cost tracking for optimization operations

#### 6. **Security Features**
- Privilege separation (agent shouldn't need root)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Resource limits and quotas
- Secure communication channels

#### 7. **Integration Features**
- Kubernetes/Docker integration for automatic triggering
- Event-driven optimization triggers
- Integration with existing monitoring systems

## Implementation Priority Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Workload Analysis Engine**
   - Basic profiling tool integration
   - Performance metric collection
   - Simple feedback channel

2. **Basic Execution Verifier**
   - eBPF verifier integration
   - Simple safety checks
   - Basic rollback mechanism

### Phase 2: Repository and Search (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Scheduler Policy Repository**
   - Vector database setup
   - Basic semantic search
   - Metadata storage

2. **Enhanced Verifier**
   - Dynamic validation
   - Deployment token system

### Phase 3: Agent System (Weeks 5-8)
1. **Agent Framework**
   - Basic agent infrastructure
   - Inter-agent communication

2. **Individual Agents**
   - Implement each agent incrementally
   - Test with simple optimization scenarios

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
1. **ICRL Implementation**
   - Learning mechanisms
   - Performance tracking

2. **Production Features**
   - Circuit breaker refinement
   - Advanced monitoring
   - Security hardening

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Current Implementation Issues
1. **No actual scheduler binaries embedded** - The sche_bin folder appears empty
2. **Limited error handling** in process execution
3. **No resource cleanup** for failed executions
4. **Basic storage system** - should upgrade to proper database
5. **No authentication/authorization** system

### Recommended Refactoring
1. Move from JSON storage to SQLite/PostgreSQL
2. Implement proper logging framework
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Create abstraction layer for scheduler execution
5. Add configuration management system

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Create stub modules for missing components
2. Design APIs for Workload Analysis Engine
3. Research vector database options
4. Create development roadmap with milestones

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. Implement basic Workload Analysis Engine
2. Add simple static verification
3. Create prototype Policy Repository
4. Begin agent framework design

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with basic scheduler management and workload profiling. However, significant work remains to implement the three core SchedCP services (Workload Analysis Engine, Policy Repository, Execution Verifier) and the multi-agent system described in the paper. The modular design of the current implementation should facilitate adding these components incrementally.

The most critical missing piece is the safety infrastructure (Execution Verifier), as running untested eBPF code poses system stability risks. This should be prioritized alongside the Workload Analysis Engine to enable meaningful optimization capabilities.
