# ShareGPT Benchmark Updates Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Downloaded Llama 3.2 3B Model ✓
- Downloaded `Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` (1.9GB)
- Model is 3x larger than TinyLlama (638MB vs 1.9GB)
- Located at: `/models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`

### 2. Fixed Server Shutdown Issues ✓
- Added `--parallel 4` flag to enable 4 concurrent slots
- Added proper wait times between request completion and server shutdown
- Added async sleep after all requests complete to ensure responses are received
- Server now handles concurrent requests properly

### 3. Updated Benchmark Script ✓
- Changed default model from TinyLlama 1.1B to Llama 3.2 3B
- Improved error handling with proper timing capture
- Server configuration now includes parallel processing support

### 4. Added Makefile Commands ✓
- Removed `run_evaluation.sh` as requested
- Added new make targets:
  - `make test-quick`: Quick test with 5 samples, 2 concurrent
  - `make test-full`: Full test with 100 samples, 10 concurrent
  - `make test-sharegpt`: Alias for quick test
  - `make bench-schedulers`: Benchmark all production schedulers
  - `make bench-custom`: Custom benchmark with env vars
  - `make download-models`: Download all required models

### 5. Key Configuration Changes

#### Server Configuration
```python
server_config = {
    "n_gpu_layers": -1,      # Use all GPU layers if available
    "ctx_size": 4096,        # Context window size
    "n_batch": 512,          # Batch size
    "n_threads": 8,          # CPU threads
    "cont_batching": True,   # Continuous batching
    "flash_attn": True,      # Flash attention
    "n_parallel": 4,         # NEW: Parallel slots for concurrent requests
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Test (5 samples)
```bash
make test-quick
```

### Full Test (100 samples)
```bash
make test-full
```

### Production Schedulers Benchmark
```bash
make bench-schedulers
```

### Custom Test
```bash
SAMPLES=20 CONCURRENT=5 make bench-custom
```

### Direct Python Command
```bash
python sharegpt_llama_server_eval.py \
    --num-samples 50 \
    --max-concurrent 8 \
    --server-logs \
    --production-only
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Concurrency**: With 4 parallel slots, server can handle multiple requests simultaneously
2. **Higher Success Rate**: Proper shutdown handling should allow all requests to complete
3. **More Realistic Testing**: 3B model provides better quality responses than 1.1B model
4. **Detailed Logging**: Server logs capture all activity for debugging

## Notes

- The 3B model requires more memory (~2GB) but provides better response quality
- Server now configured for true concurrent processing with 4 slots
- All test results include system information and timestamps
- Output directories are auto-named with dataset, sample count, and timestamp
