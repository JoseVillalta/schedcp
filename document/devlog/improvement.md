# SchedCP Implementation Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the improvements needed to align the current SchedCP implementation with the research paper specifications. The analysis reveals that while the basic MCP server framework exists, all three core services (Workload Analysis Engine, Policy Repository, and Execution Verifier) and the multi-agent system are missing.

## Gap Analysis

### Core Services Status

| Component | Paper Requirements | Current Implementation | Gap |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-----|
| **Workload Analysis Engine** | Tiered access, profiling tools, eBPF probes, adaptive context | ❌ Not implemented | 100% |
| **Policy Repository** | Vector DB, semantic search, code storage, performance metrics | ❌ Basic static JSON only | 95% |
| **Execution Verifier** | Multi-stage validation, static/dynamic analysis, rollback | ❌ No validation | 100% |
| **Multi-Agent System** | 4 specialized agents with ICRL | ❌ Not implemented | 100% |

## Improvement Roadmap

### 🚨 Phase 0: Critical Safety Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Current system can crash kernel**

```rust
// Required: Basic safety wrapper before ANY other work
pub struct SafetyWrapper {
    verifier: BasicVerifier,
    rollback: RollbackManager,
    circuit_breaker: CircuitBreaker,
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement basic eBPF verification wrapper
- [ ] Add process isolation for scheduler execution
- [ ] Create emergency killswitch mechanism
- [ ] Add basic resource limits

### 📊 Phase 1: Workload Analysis Engine (Weeks 2-3)

**Architecture:**
```
WorkloadAnalysisEngine/
├── src/
│   ├── profiler.rs         # Profiling tool integration
│   ├── metrics.rs          # Performance metric collection
│   ├── ebpf_probes.rs      # Dynamic probe attachment
│   └── feedback.rs         # Post-deployment analysis
├── sandbox/                # Isolated execution environment
└── api/                    # Tiered access endpoints
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Profiling Integration**
   ```rust
   pub trait Profiler {
       async fn run_perf_stat(&self, duration: Duration) -> PerfStats;
       async fn attach_ebpf_probe(&self, probe: Probe) -> ProbeHandle;
       async fn collect_metrics(&self) -> SystemMetrics;
   }
   ```

2. **Sandbox Environment**
   - Use firecracker-microvm or gVisor
   - Resource quotas and time limits
   - Read-only filesystem mounts
   - Network isolation

3. **Adaptive Context API**
   ```rust
   pub enum ContextLevel {
       Summary,      // High-level metrics only
       Detailed,     // Include profiling data
       Comprehensive // Full trace and probe data
   }
   ```

### 🗄️ Phase 2: Scheduler Policy Repository (Weeks 4-5)

**Technology Stack:**
- Vector DB: Qdrant (Rust-native) or ChromaDB
- Embeddings: Use OpenAI/Claude API for semantic search
- Storage: PostgreSQL for metadata, S3/MinIO for eBPF code

**Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE scheduler_policies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    ebpf_code TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR(1536),
    performance_metrics JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE performance_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    policy_id UUID REFERENCES scheduler_policies,
    workload_profile_id UUID,
    metrics JSONB,
    execution_time TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Implementation:**
```rust
pub struct PolicyRepository {
    vector_db: QdrantClient,
    metadata_db: PgPool,
    code_store: ObjectStore,
}

impl PolicyRepository {
    pub async fn semantic_search(&self, query: &str, limit: usize) -> Vec<Policy>;
    pub async fn store_policy(&self, policy: Policy) -> Result<PolicyId>;
    pub async fn update_metrics(&self, id: PolicyId, metrics: Metrics) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### 🛡️ Phase 3: Execution Verifier (Weeks 6-7)

**Validation Pipeline:**
```
Code Submission → Static Analysis → Dynamic Testing → Deployment Token
                        ↓                ↓                    ↓
                  eBPF Verifier    Micro-VM Test      Signed JWT
                  Custom Checks    Perf Baseline       Rollback ID
```

**Components:**
1. **Static Analyzer**
   ```rust
   pub struct StaticAnalyzer {
       ebpf_verifier: Verifier,
       custom_rules: Vec<Rule>,
   }
   
   impl StaticAnalyzer {
       pub fn check_memory_safety(&self, code: &str) -> Result<()>;
       pub fn check_fairness_properties(&self, code: &str) -> Result<()>;
       pub fn estimate_overhead(&self, code: &str) -> Overhead;
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Validator**
   - Firecracker microVM setup
   - Synthetic workload suite
   - Performance regression tests
   - Timeout and resource monitoring

3. **Deployment System**
   ```rust
   pub struct DeploymentToken {
       policy_id: PolicyId,
       signature: Signature,
       expires_at: Timestamp,
       rollback_snapshot: Snapshot,
   }
   ```

### 🤖 Phase 4: Multi-Agent System (Weeks 8-11)

**Agent Architecture:**
```
sched-agent/
├── framework/
│   ├── agent_base.rs       # Base agent traits
│   ├── communication.rs    # Inter-agent messaging
│   └── context.rs          # ICRL implementation
├── agents/
│   ├── observation.rs      # Workload analysis
│   ├── planning.rs         # Policy selection/generation
│   ├── execution.rs        # Validation and deployment
│   └── learning.rs         # Performance feedback loop
└── prompts/
    └── system_prompts.toml # Agent-specific prompts
```

**Agent Implementation Example:**
```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Agent {
    async fn process(&mut self, message: Message) -> Result<Response>;
    async fn get_tools(&self) -> Vec<Tool>;
    fn get_system_prompt(&self) -> &str;
}

pub struct ObservationAgent {
    analysis_engine: Arc<WorkloadAnalysisEngine>,
    context: AgentContext,
}

impl ObservationAgent {
    pub async fn analyze_workload(&mut self, workload_id: &str) -> WorkloadProfile {
        // 1. Query high-level metrics
        // 2. Decide if deeper analysis needed
        // 3. Run appropriate profiling tools
        // 4. Synthesize into WorkloadProfile
    }
}
```

**ICRL Implementation:**
```rust
pub struct ICRLContext {
    history: VecDeque<Experience>,
    max_context: usize,
}

pub struct Experience {
    state: WorkloadProfile,
    action: SchedulerConfig,
    reward: PerformanceMetrics,
}
```

## Conclusion

The current SchedCP implementation provides a foundation but lacks the critical safety and intelligence features described in the paper. This improvement plan prioritizes safety first, followed by the core services that enable autonomous optimization. With dedicated effort over 12 weeks, we can build a production-ready system that safely optimizes Linux schedulers using AI agents.
