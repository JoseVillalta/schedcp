  I've successfully created and run an eBPF scheduler that:

  1. Tracks scheduler events - monitors context switches, wakeups, new tasks,
   and CPU migrations
  2. Collects statistics - counts total switches, wakeups, and per-CPU
  statistics
  3. Outputs trace logs - prints periodic updates when thresholds are reached
  4. Uses multiple tracepoints:
    - sched_switch - tracks context switches
    - sched_wakeup - tracks task wakeups
    - sched_wakeup_new - tracks new task creation
    - sched_migrate_task - tracks CPU migrations

  The scheduler compiled successfully and is running in the kernel, producing
   trace output visible in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe.
