‚óè Yes, this is a FIFO scheduler. The key evidence:

  1. Single shared queue: Uses one custom dispatch queue (MY_DSQ_ID) for all tasks
  2. Simple enqueue: Tasks are dispatched to the queue in arrival order
  (simple_scheduler.bpf.c:93)
  3. Sequential consumption: The simple_dispatch function consumes tasks from the queue
   in order (simple_scheduler.bpf.c:109)
  4. No reordering: There's no priority-based reordering or preemption logic

  The scheduler maintains FIFO ordering within its custom dispatch queue, making it a
  basic FIFO scheduler with some CPU affinity optimizations for performance.
