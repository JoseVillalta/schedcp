# ShareGPT Benchmark Log Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of the server logs from the ShareGPT benchmark test with 5 samples and 2 concurrent requests.

## Key Findings

### 1. Server Configuration
- **Model**: TinyLlama 1.1B Chat v1.0 (Q4_K_M quantization)
- **Model Size**: 636.18 MiB (4.85 bits per weight)
- **Context Size**: 4096 tokens (expanded from training context of 2048)
- **Batch Size**: 512
- **Threads**: 8 worker threads (out of 172 available)
- **Flash Attention**: Enabled
- **GPU**: Not available (CPU-only execution)

### 2. Performance Metrics

From the logs, we can see 3 successful requests were processed:

#### Request 1 (Task 0)
- Prompt tokens: 63
- Response tokens: 1 (appears truncated)
- Prompt eval: 171.59 ms (367.15 tokens/sec)
- Generation: 0.04 ms (28571.43 tokens/sec - likely anomaly due to single token)

#### Request 2 (Task 2)
- Prompt tokens: 124
- Response tokens: 200
- Prompt eval: 288.68 ms (426.08 tokens/sec)
- Generation: 1998.60 ms (100.07 tokens/sec)
- Total: 323 tokens in 2287.28 ms

#### Request 3 (Task 4)
- Prompt tokens: 19
- Response tokens: 200
- Prompt eval: 60.40 ms (298.02 tokens/sec)
- Generation: 1961.95 ms (101.94 tokens/sec)
- Total: 218 tokens in 2022.35 ms

### 3. Why Only 3/5 Requests Succeeded

The logs show only tasks 0, 2, and 4 were processed, suggesting:

1. **Task ID Pattern**: Tasks are numbered 0, 2, 4 (even numbers only)
   - This indicates the server processed requests sequentially
   - Odd-numbered tasks (1, 3) are missing

2. **Server Shutdown**: The log ends with "cleaning up before exit"
   - The server was terminated after processing 3 requests
   - This matches the test timeout or completion logic

3. **Concurrent Request Handling**: With max_concurrent=2:
   - The server appears to be processing requests one at a time
   - No true concurrent processing visible in these logs
   - This is likely due to the single-slot configuration (`n_slots = 1`)

### 4. Technical Issues Identified

1. **No GPU Support**:
   ```
   warning: no usable GPU found, --gpu-layers option will be ignored
   warning: llama.cpp was compiled without GPU support
   ```
   - Running on CPU only significantly impacts performance
   - Generation speed ~100 tokens/sec is typical for CPU execution

2. **Context Overflow Warning**:
   ```
   n_ctx_per_seq (4096) > n_ctx_train (2048) -- possible training context overflow
   ```
   - Model was trained on 2048 tokens but configured for 4096
   - May impact quality for longer sequences

3. **Single Slot Configuration**:
   ```
   srv init: initializing slots, n_slots = 1
   ```
   - Server configured with only 1 concurrent slot
   - Explains why requests are processed sequentially
   - To handle concurrent requests, need to increase slot count

### 5. Performance Summary

- **Prompt Processing**: 298-426 tokens/sec (CPU)
- **Text Generation**: ~100 tokens/sec (CPU)
- **Average Response Length**: 134-201 tokens
- **Success Rate**: 60% (3/5) - limited by server configuration

## Recommendations

1. **Enable GPU Support**: Compile llama.cpp with CUDA/ROCm support for better performance
2. **Increase Slots**: Configure server with multiple slots for true concurrent processing
3. **Adjust Context Size**: Match context size to model training (2048) or use a model trained for longer contexts
4. **Monitor Task IDs**: Investigate why only even-numbered tasks are processed
5. **Extend Test Duration**: Ensure server runs long enough to process all requests

## Conclusion

The 60% success rate is primarily due to:
- Single-slot server configuration limiting concurrent processing
- Server shutdown/timeout after processing 3 requests
- Sequential processing of requests despite concurrent submission

This is a configuration issue rather than a performance limitation. With proper multi-slot configuration and adequate runtime, all requests should complete successfully.
