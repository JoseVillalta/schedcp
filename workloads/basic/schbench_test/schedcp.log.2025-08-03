2025-08-03T04:40:49.576698Z  INFO create_workload_profile called with description: schbench - High-performance scheduler benchmark simulating web server workloads. This workload creates a producer-consumer pattern with message threads distributing work to worker threads. Key characteristics: (1) Mixed CPU-intensive and I/O simulation with alternating compute and sleep phases, (2) Each request involves 100μs sleep (simulating I/O), followed by 5 matrix multiplications (64x64 matrices, ~256KB cache footprint), then 10μs response sleep, (3) Uses per-CPU spinlocks to model preemption costs, (4) Default configuration runs 2 message threads with 4 workers each for 30 seconds, (5) Critical metrics are wakeup latency (time from wake to execution), request latency (end-to-end), and throughput (requests/sec). The workload is particularly sensitive to scheduler wakeup efficiency, CPU affinity decisions, and timeslice allocation. Optimal schedulers should minimize wakeup latency while maintaining high CPU utilization and avoiding unnecessary thread migrations that disrupt cache locality.
