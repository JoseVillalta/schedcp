PyVSAG Vector Database Benchmark Methodology

Experimental Setup:
- Vector Database: PyVSAG (Python bindings for VSAG)
- Index Type: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- Vector Dimension: 128 
- Dataset Size: 50,000 vectors
- Query Set: 1,000 random queries
- k-NN Search: k=10 nearest neighbors

Index Configuration:
- HNSW max_degree: 16 (max connections per node)
- HNSW ef_construction: 200 (expansion factor during construction)
- HNSW ef_search: 100 (expansion factor during search)
- Distance Metric: L2 (Euclidean distance)

Measurement Process:
1. Data Generation: Random float32 vectors with fixed seed for reproducibility
2. Index Building: Timed construction of HNSW index structure
3. Warmup Phase: 10 initial queries to stabilize performance
4. Search Benchmark: 
   - Individual timing for each of 1,000 k-NN queries
   - Records per-query latency for percentile analysis
5. Metrics Collection:
   - Throughput: Queries Per Second (QPS)
   - Latency: Average, P95, P99 query times (milliseconds)
   - Recall: Accuracy of nearest neighbor retrieval

Performance Results:
Throughput (QPS):
  default: 3607.09
  DuplexOS: 3934.57
  Improvement: 9.1%

Average Query Latency (ms):
  default: 0.276432
  DuplexOS: 0.253372
  Improvement: 8.3% (lower is better)
